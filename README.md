# FinalProject
The purpose of this application is to help hosting and finding various meet-ups and gatherings. 
The events can be both private, like study groups and office parties, open to just your friends and colleges, 
or public, like conventions and workshops, open to anyone who shares the interest and is willing to attend. 
It can be a helpful way of meeting more people without having much communication. It can even be an innovative way of gathering. 
Probably dating apps won’t be needed if we are looking forward for this app.
